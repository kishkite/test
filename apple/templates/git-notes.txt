git notes:

problem1: hard disk failure or computer crash
problem2: hard to work multiple people to work on same code
problem3: difficult to track changes, revert back to previous version

version control system solves all problems

solution1: the code is saved on cloud and it is guaranteed that we never lose the code. 
store the code on the cloud and then sync the files to your local computer.

solution2: golden copy is maintained on cloud.multiple people can work on same code. code merges happens using mergetool.

solution3: vcs maintains version history, you can revert to any of the previous state of your code.

Git is distributed control system and version history is maitained in local system and cloud

GITHUB to host code is powered by git
